## Weapons 3D Models
These are 3D weapon designs that you can use to spice up your game.
First, download and extract the archive of the weapon you want. Then move the numbered asset files to your mod's asset file. Finally, you can make it work by refreshing the game once.

## Viewmodel.js
It is a script file that adjusts the weapon position. 

**Original project:** [Viewmodel.js](https://github.com/sheeshKAAN/Viewmodel.js)
